# Python List Project

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding elements.

## Description

The Python script performs the following operations:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.



##  How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `my_list.py`.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
my_list.py
